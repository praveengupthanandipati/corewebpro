                      The design process starts way before we put pencil to paper
                      and sketch out that first wireframe. Good design needs to be
                      useful â€” our designers and product managers spend their first
                      several hours with you understanding your users, their needs,
                      digging into any data you already have and and observing the
                      current industry landscape.
